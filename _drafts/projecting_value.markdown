In the post 
[Action, Perception and Theory of Mind,](/blog/2016/02/22/1456064564-value_perception_action_tom.html)
I layed out a few ideas about discussing actions, observations, perceptions, theory of mind, and
how they relate to interpersonal and inter-group dynamics.
The text was kept quite abstract, but now I would like to use a few concrete examples
in order to show how to take advantage of these new concepts.

Here we use the same
[Two-Body Problem](/blog/2016/02/22/1456064564-value_perception_action_tom.html#the-two-body-two-parties-per-body-problem)
from the other post, but instead of nameless parties, I use human names.
Instead of abstract actions, I use physical actions, and instead of
amorphous bodies, I use companies. This scenario is going to be picked apart
from a "Value" perspective.
