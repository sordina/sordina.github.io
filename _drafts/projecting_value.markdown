In the post 
[Action, Perception and Theory of Mind,](/blog/2016/02/22/1456064564-value_perception_action_tom.html)
I layed out a few ideas about discussing actions, observations, perceptions, theory of mind, and
how they relate to interpersonal and inter-group dynamics.
The text was kept quite abstract, but now I would like to use a few concrete examples
in order to show how to take advantage of these new concepts.

Here we use the same
[Two-Body Problem](/blog/2016/02/22/1456064564-value_perception_action_tom.html#the-two-body-two-parties-per-body-problem)
from the other post, but instead of nameless parties, I use human names.
Instead of abstract actions, I use concrete actions, and instead of
amorphous bodies, I use companies. This scenario is going to be studied
from a "Value" perspective.

## The Scenario


         Puppy Toys LLC          Cat Snack Corp
        +--------------+        +--------------+
        |              |   A    |              |
        |              | -----> |              |
        |     Dave     |        |    Alice     |
        |              |   C    |              |
        |           +---------> |              |
        |          /   |        |              |
        |         /    |   D    |              |
        |        /     | --------------+       |
        |       /      |        |      |       |
        |              |   S    |      V       |
        |     Sam -----------------> Carol     |
        |              |        |              |
        +--------------+        +--------------+


Imagine that there is only one objective action, but that it is obscured.

Instead, we have four interpretations of the obscured action:

* [A - Alice's Interpretation](#alices-interpretation)
* [C - Carol's Interpretation](#carols-interpretation)
* [D - Dave's Interpretation](#daves-interpretation)
* [S - Sam's Interpretation](#sams-interpretation)

We won't go into which is right or not. It is enough to see that each interpretation
arrises from the ambiguous, erroneous, and subjective perceptions and
circumstances that the action took place in.

## Alice's Interpretation

Alice interprets that Puppy-Toys has made a threat towards Cat-Snack Corp.

## Carol's Interpretation

Carol interprets that Sam has made a threat towards Cat-Snack Corp.

## Dave's Interpretation

Dave interprets that Puppy-Toys has threatened Carol, personally.

## Sam's Interpretation

Sam interprets that he threatened Carol, personally.


# Analysis

If you want to analyse a situation such as this, it is important to remember that you
do not have the objective truth either, and it is important to draw up all of the
likely scenarios that occured before you perform analysis.

Let's have a take a step up the ladder and look at the theory of mind of each of our
parties. Luckily, since there is only one action being percieved by each, there
won't be the combinatorial explosion discussed in the previous post.
