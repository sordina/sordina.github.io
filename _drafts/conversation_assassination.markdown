<!-- Scenarios -->

Have you ever been in the middle of a really engrosing and productive conversation,
only to have it die on you? Maybe it was assassinated by your interlocutor, or maybe
you killed it yourself unknowingly...

direction? Going somewhere that you really didn't want to go? Did you feel
powerless to stop it? Maybe you should have killed it!
