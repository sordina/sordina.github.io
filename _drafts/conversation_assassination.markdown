<!-- Scenarios -->

Have you ever been in the middle of a really engrosing and productive conversation,
only to have it die on you? Maybe it was assassinated by your interlocutor, or maybe
you killed it yourself unknowingly...

Conversly, have you ever had a conversation that was headed in exactly the wrong
direction? Going somewhere that you really didn't want to go? Did you feel
powerless to stop it? Maybe you should have killed it!

## The Conversation

Since we're going to be talking about a lot of different examples of conversations
that meet an untimely demise, it pays to have an example of a good conversation
to see what makes a high-quality one, and speculate where it could have gone wrong.


For reference - The ["Walk the Earth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh-QWKGbm2Q)
Conversation [from Pulp Fiction.](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction)

This conversation has many qualities that you could at first be interpreted as
weapons of assassination, but on closer inspection they are actually what
give it the potential to be a valuable exchange.

* Difference of oppinion
* Strong views
* Desire for resolution
* Past conversational experience
* Tried friendship
* An abrupt suspension

The conversation:

	Jules: Man, I just been sitting here thinking.

	Vincent: About what?

	Jules: About the miracle we just witnessed.

	Vincent: The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.

	Jules: What is a miracle, Vincent?

	Vincent: An act of God.

	Jules: And what's an act of God?

	Vincent: When God makes the impossible possible. But this morning, I don't
	         think it qualifies.

	Jules: Hey, Vincent, don't you see? That shit don't matter. You're judging
	       this shit the wrong way. I mean, it could be that God stopped the bullets, or
	       He changed Coke to Pepsi, He found my fucking car keys. You don't judge shit
	       like this based on merit. Now, whether or not what we experienced was an
	       "according to Hoyle" miracle is insignificant. What is significant is that
	       I felt the touch of God. God got involved.

	Vincent: But why?

	Jules: Well, that's what's fucking with me. I don't know why, but I can't go
	       back to sleep.

	Vincent: You serious? You're really thinking about quitting?

	Jules: The life?

	Vincent: Yeah.

	Jules: Most definitely.

	Vincent: Oh, fuck. What'cha gonna do, then?

	Jules: Well, that's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm
	       going to deliver this case to Marsellus, then, basically, I'm just going to
	       walk the Earth.

	Vincent: What'cha mean, "walk the Earth"?

	Jules: You know, like Caine in Kung Fu: walk from place to place, meet
	       people, get into adventures.

	Vincent: And how long do you intend to walk the Earth?

	Jules: Until God puts me where he wants me to be.

	Vincent: And what if he don't do that?

	Jules: If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.

	Vincent: So you decided to be a bum?

	Jules: I'll just be Jules, Vincent; no more, no less.

	Vincent: No, Jules. You've decided to be a bum. Just like those pieces of
	         shit out there who beg for change, sleep in garbage bins and eat what I throw
	         away. They got a name for that, Jules: it's called "a bum". And without
	         a job, a residence or legal tender, that's exactly what you're going to be:
	         a fucking bum.

	Jules: Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.

	Vincent: Jules, look, what happened this morning, I agree, it was peculiar.
	         But water into wine, I...

	Jules: All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

	Vincent: Don't fucking talk to me like that, man.

	Jules: If my answers frighten you, then you should cease asking scary
	       questions.

	Vincent: [pauses, looking annoyed] I'm gonna take a shit. Let me ask you
	         something, when did you make this decision? When you were sitting there
	         eating that muffin?

	Jules: Yeah, I was sitting here, eating my muffin and drinking my coffee and
	       replaying the incident in my head, when I had what alcoholics refer to as
	       a moment of clarity.

	Vincent: Fuck. To be continued.

## The Weapons of an Assassin

An assassin may, or may not know what they are about to do, but unless they are
armed and strike, then the conversation will not die... That isn't to say it
might not end, but that is a different thing entirely.

What weapons are in the armory?

### Death by Monotony

Monotony is characterized by a lack of diversity.
Here, the conversation is on-point, but that point
doesn't evolve, deepen, or abstract. This can kill
the conversation becase a feeling will develop between
the parties of a lack of progress. This can be
boring, or worse, frustrating. Not just frustrating
because of the situation that you have ended up in,
but because of your own impotence to prevent it
from occurring, and inability to pull yourself
out of the mire now that you are there.

Now, tangos take two. If there is one active conversationalist, then they
can rescue the conversation by changing direction
and introducing novelty.

#### A Homogenous Example

	Jules: Man, I just been sitting here thinking.

	Vincent: About what?

	Jules: About the miracle we just witnessed.

	Vincent: The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.

	Jules: What is a miracle, Vincent?

	Vincent: An act of God.

	Jules: And what's an act of God?

	Vincent: When God makes the impossible possible. But this morning, I don't
	         think it qualifies.

	Jules: You might say that, but I know what I saw; A miracle.

	Vincent: But it was a miracle?

	Jules: Yeah man, a miracle.

	Vincent: Why exactly was it a miracle then?

	Jules: Let me tell you Jules, it was a miracle because the way I see it,
	       God acted.

	Vincent: You sure it wasn't something else?
	         I mean, yeah, I just don't think it really should be called a
	         miracle.

	Jules: Well let me just say this: What I saw convinced me. This was the
	       real deal. Something miraculous happened. Believe it.

	Vincent: I dunno man. I just don't see it.

	Jules: Well then, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.

	Vincent: Whatever man, this is going nowhere.
	         [pauses, looking annoyed] I'm gonna take a shit...
	         Then let's get out of here.
	         You do what you gotta do.

	Jules: Yeah. I will.


The thing about Tarantino's dialogues is that they move.
This stagnated and died. There was a disagreement, but the
motivations weren't explored. The implications weren't looked
at, and there was no real attempt at resolution. This could
have been a tweet from Jules with the same effect.

	Jules Winnfield @jwinnfield - 2h
	What happened today was a real miracle. I Quit.

### Death by Trivialization

Trivialization and reductionism are very capable of killing a
conversation. These weapons can be used by a single party
to bring the discussion to a premature close, through the
annoyance at misrepresentation of the party who's points
are being trivialized.

#### A Trivial Example

### Death by Drowning

* Focusing too much
* Demanding Resolution to Every Point, Never Progressing

* Trivialities

### Death by Humor

* Jokes

### Death by Pithiness

* Trying to make every sentence be close ended

### Death by Sarcasm

* The inability to take anything seriously

### Death by Pedantry

* Irrelevant pedantry

#### A Pedantic Example

A: 

### Death by Misunderstanding

* Interpreting your partner's thrust incorrectly, and basing your
  conversation on that

#### A Misunderstood Example

### Death by Podium

* Not listening
* Non-conversation - Speach-Giving / Waiting for gaps (everyone knows this)

#### A Dictated Example

### Death by Dispersion

* Non-Sequiturs
* Frequent and untracable topic-shifts

#### A Scattered Example

### Death by Dull

* Lack of focus
* "Meh" responses
* Lack of interest

#### An Unfocused Example
