Sometimes the complexity of a situation precludes
honest analysis, and we resort to gross simplification
in order to get a grip, or at least pretend that
we have a grip. We characterize the personalities
involved in terms of overly-simplified, or
popularly false straw men. This can be effective in
fooling ourselves that we aren't as helpless in our
attempts to understand as is the case in reality,
and maybe that is a desire that should be sympathised
with, but is there a general framework for progressive
comprehension without resorting to this strategy?
