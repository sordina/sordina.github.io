## Fantasizing is often looked down on

* As distinct from day-dreaming
* Attributes of mania
* Unrealistic
* Not-Useful

## But, You can remedy some of these issues

<!--more-->

* Start with the fantasy
* Make it as realistic and engrosing as possible
* Then in that Fantasy
* Rest on your laurels
* And reflect
* Reflect back onto how you rose to such a position
* Look at the recent path to your achievement with pride
* And be especially proud of how you came from humble beginnings

## Dynamic-Programming comes in two parts

* The search forward
* The search backwards

## You are Already Performing the Forward-Search

* Keep your goals achievable and realistic

## Perform the Backward-Search

* Fantasy provides a simulated mechanism for the backward-search

## Example
