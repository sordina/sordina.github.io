I started writing this post in an attempt to capture certain ideas about how
value is projected, and how those projections can be misconstrued. Halfway there
I began to realize that I was instead creating a kind of embedded language for
discussing the perceptions of actions in general. This post will, therefore,
focus on the idea of action perception, with some examples. I will soon write
another post to get back to the original topic viewed from with the help of the
ideas discussed here.

Let's talk a little about the title.

Most of the interactions in our day-to-day lives are
just that - actions. These actions occur between people,
groups, objects, or are self-inflicted. We mostly limit
our conversations about these actions to remarks about
their circumstances, and the details involved in their
construction and execution. However,
[if a tree falls in a forest, and it is not perceived, does it still make a sound?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest)
It is important to keep in mind the contexts and interpretations
of the _perceptions_ of actions that occur.

## Action

An action is an objective real-world event that occurs between
concrete or abstract entities within in the world.

> Bob pours himself a glass of water.

## Observation

An observation is the concrete phenomenon of the receipt of information
by an entity pertaining to an action.

> Alice hears Bob pour the water from another room.

## Perception

Perception is the witnessing-entity's understanding of the
information pertaining to the action that it observed.

> Alice understands that that someone in the other room poured a liquid into a vessel.

## Inaction

The simplest form of action is no action at all.
It exhibits no observable phenomenon aside from a lack
of observations. Still, although there are no observations
to be made, there are still an infinity of perceptions
of inaction that are possible through the interpretation
of the meaning of the non-event.

There could be a wealth of content to be written about
inaction, but I won't touch on it any further here. Instead focusing
on singular observable actions.

## Parties

Although actions cab be described as occurring between abstract entities,
the simplest type of entity is the "Party". A party is a single actor
such as a person, or animal. Parties can perform and receive actions,
but they can also observe and perceive actions. Parties can also go
further and extend thought processes further than simple interpretations of
the concrete.

A simple diagram of three parties can be shown as follows:

	Alice     Bob
	
	          Carol

## Self-Action

The simplest concrete action is self-action. This is because it requires
only one entity to perform and receive the action. The same entity
can observe and perceive the action, and their thoughts need pertain
only to themselves.

An example of a self-action could be Bob's refreshment from earlier:

> Bob pours himself a glass of water.


## One-Party Problem

The previous example of Bob's refreshment (sans witnesses) is a variant
of what I call "The One-Party Problem". A Party performs an Action upon
itself. It observes that action, and perceives it. Although this seems
to be a contrived and solipsistic construction of an example, there is still
something to be gained by examining the forces at play in the scenario.

* Are actions in this scenario important?
* Can the party involved form an objective interpretation of the events that unfolded?
* How linked are action, observation, and perception?
* Is the party merely perceiving the scenario, or also transformed by those perceptions?

And so, the "Perceptive-Graph" for the One-Party Problem:

	   /-----+
	   :     : AP1
	   :     v
	Party 1 ---+
	   ^       |
	   |   A   |
	   |       |
	   \-------+

* One party acts on itself
* "Party 1" represents the party
* "A" represents the action
* There is an implicit group present containing "Party 1", however, this doesn't matter for single parties
* "AP1" represents "Party 1"s perception of action "A"

Currently AP1 is explicitly drawn on the graph, however, there are such
arrows from every party to every action, so we may leave them out of the
diagrams and refer to them via the convention (Action)-(Party).
These can then be referenced and discussed in tabular form.

The diagram then simply becomes an Action-Entity graph. In this example:

	Party 1 ---+
	   ^       |
	   |   A   |
	   |       |
	   \-------+

## Analysis

For any particular Action-Entity graph an analysis can be performed.
This takes the form of a series of levels of descriptions. With the items being
described becoming more abstract with each level.

The levels begin as follows:

* Parties, Groups and Actions
* Observations and Perceptions
* Theory Of Mind

After the initial action-entity diagram has been constructed, each successive
level of abstraction can be generated by taking the cross-product of the
previous level of abstraction with the set of entities. For example, each party
perceives all actions, and each party also models all such perceptions.
For scenarios composed of many entities and actions, this can lead to
a combinatorial explosion of descriptions. However, if you refer to entities
purely through abstract circumstance, then you will find that many of these
descriptions will be identical, and their implications only need to be
considered once.

There is no limit to how many levels of abstraction can be analysed, but
three should be sufficient for most practical discussion.

Here is analysis of the One-Party Problem

## Group-Perceptions

## Perception of Group-Actions

## What's Next?

This post has been laying the groundwork for future discussions.
I'd like to take this framework and use it to analyse various
contentious situations to see if there can be a better understanding
of conflict, and what paths might be navigated to resolve it.

There are a lot of words written here, but hopefully I've kept it
simple. The main take-away should be the notion of the
action-entity diagram and the tabular descriptive analysis format.

Stay tuned!
