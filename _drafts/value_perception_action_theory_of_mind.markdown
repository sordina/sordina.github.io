I started writing this in an attempt to capture certain ideas
about how value projections can be misconstrued. Halfway there
I began to realize that I was instead creating a kind of
embedded language for discussing the perceptions of actions
in general. This post will, therefore, focus on the idea
of action perception, with some examples.
I will soon write another post to get back to the original topic
viewed from with the help of the ideas discussed here.

Let's talk a little about the title.

Most of the interactions in our day-to-day lives are
just that - actions. These actions occur between people,
groups, objects, or are self-inflicted. We mostly limit
our conversations about these actions to remarks about
their circumstances, and the details involved in their
construction and execution.
However, if a tree falls in a forrest, and nobody is there
to witness it, does it make a noise?
It is important to keep in mind the contexts and interpretations
of the _perceptions_ of actions that occur.

Notes:

* The interplay between domestic and international politics is fascinating and enlightening.
* If global actions seem bizarre, ask yourself, do you understand the domestic context?
* Example: North Korea
* Respect and Value are often confused and conflated
* Theory of Mind
* How to talk about conflict
* How to talk about interpretation and mis-interpretation of events, ideas, and perceptions

## The One-Party Problem

	Party 1 ---+
	   ^       |
	   |   A   |
	   |       |
	   \-------+

* One party acts on itself
* This is the simplest possible example besides the null problem
* (One party - One body) = One Party
* Bodies only become meaningful with more than one party in them

### Parties

* Party 1

### Actions

* A

### Interpretation of Actions

| ----- | ------------ | ----------| ------------------------------------- |
| ID    | Interaction  | Observer  | Comment (How does a [X] percieve... ) |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------| ------------------------------------- |
| AP1   | A            | Party 1   | [Party] its actions towards itself?

### Theory of Mind

| ----- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ID    | Interaction  | Observer   | Theorist | Comment (What are an [X]'s thoughts about... ) |

## The Minimum One-Body Problem

### Interpretation of Actions

| AB1   | A            | Body 1    | [Group] the interaction between two of its members?
| BB1   | B            | Body 1    | [Group] the actions of one of its members to itself?
| BB1   | C            | Body 1    | [Group] the actions of itself to one of its members?

## The Two-Body, Two-Parties-Per-Body Problem

Perception of value can be characterized as global, or domestic.

	      +--------------+        +--------------+

	      +--------------+        +--------------+
	           |   ^                   |   ^
	           | K |      Party 5      | L |
	           +---/                   +---/

Notes 2:

* Group Perceptions - What does it mean for a group to percieve?
* Canonical form - Observations relative to a perciever
* Self deception and self perception
* Can we remove the 'F' arrow? Only if it provides at least one unique scenario
* Changes references of `Body` to `Group`
* Add I,J,K and L
