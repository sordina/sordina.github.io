title: "How to Meaningfully Critique Modern Art"
categories: blog
---

So many times I hear the opinion: "Modern art has
gone too far. It has lost all meaning, skill,
and sincerity. Especially This Piece, which I just
heard about, which is an extraordinarily bad example.

This is basically a template for nearly all popular
negative criticism of modern art. If you're about
to say the same thing, then you do yourself a disservice
if you don't take your criticism to a place where
it adds something new, or at the very least - provides
a structural dismissal of the work you are critiquing.

Do you have non-flippant answers to the following questions?

* Why am I taken aback by this piece so late in the game?
  Do I have a fresh opinion about this?
* Am I ignoring the context in which the art was created?
* In my aesthetic argument, then why are my aesthetics superior?
* In my aesthetic argument, why do the artists alternative
  aesthetics lack merit?
* Am I describing what the artist was attempting to
  achieve with the work, then arguing that this has failed?

## Classes of critique

* Aesthetics
	- Aesthetic superiority
	- One true aesthetic
		* Usually boils down to some form of realism / representation
* Absurdist
	- Accusation of meaninglessness / lack of intent in the design
	- Failure to imbue meaning into the piece by construction
* Contextualised
	- Entirely dependent on context
	- Too heavily dependent on context
* Fundamental
	- Disagreement with the message, not the art itself
* Reductionist
	- Lack of originality
