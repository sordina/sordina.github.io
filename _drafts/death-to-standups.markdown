The standup is a mainstay of modern agile development teams.

It evolved as an attempt to keep meetings short and regular.

* We want to facilitate communication
* Meetings attempt to do this, but are unstructured, and go on too long
* If we stand when we have a meeting, peoples legs will get sore, and the
  meeting will have to be kept short
* Stand-up meetings still go on too long, and lack structure, but now our
  legs are sore too

The thrust of enhancing communication is to ensure that everyone knows
what other members of the team are up to, and what the current focus is.

This ritual is often paired with Kanban style card walls so that tasks and
progress can be represented symbolically and made visible. This can be
beneficial, but isn't nececerily part of stand-up itself...

Given that we have the means and the motivation for more on-line
communication between team members these days, why do we need a wacky
meeting structure like stand-up at all?

Can't we just tell each other what we're doing on slack?

I've been experiementing with a simple newsletter aiming to do a weekly
round-up of the top slack posts in order to facilitate cohesion and
shared focus.

Properties:

* A heading for each team-member, hilighting interesting Slack exerpts
* If there was nothing shared, then simply the text "No Update"

This is intended to encorage sharing within the channel anything
interesting, so that people are aware of their own visibility.
