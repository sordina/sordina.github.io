I think this is true, but that the beauty is meant to serve as a farcical
contrast to the triviality and lack of meaning in Barry's story. The point was
really driven home with the final scene of the story being accompanied by
Handel's Sarabande, a work of monumental gravitas implying transcendent
tragedy, when in reality Barry was a nobody, a jerk with no morals or
conviction hardly deserving a second thought.
