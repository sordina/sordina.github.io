title: "Value and Respect - Domestic Vs. Global"
categories: blog
---

The interplay between domestic and international politics is fascinating and enlightening.

Notes:

* If global actions seem bizarre, ask yourself, do you understand the domestic context?
* Example: North Korea
* Respect and Value are often confused and conflated
* Theory of Mind
* How to talk about conflict
* How to talk about interpretation and mis-interpretation of events, ideas, and perceptions

## The One-Party Problem

	Party 1 ---+
	   ^       |
	   |   A   |
	   |       |
	   +-------+

* (One party - One body) = One Party
* Bodies only become meaningful with more than one party in them

### Parties

* Party 1

### Actions

* A

## The Minimum Two-Body Problem

Perception of value can be characterized as global, or domestic.

	           Body 1                  Body 2
	      +--------------+        +--------------+

	      +--------------+        +--------------+

Notes 2:

* Group Perceptions - What does it mean for a group to percieve?
* Canonical form - Observations relative to a perciever
* Self deception and self perception
* Can we remove the 'F' arrow? Only if it provides at least one unique scenario
* Changes references of `Body` to `Group`
* Add I,J,K and L
