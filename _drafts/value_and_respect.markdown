title: "Value and Respect - Domestic Vs. Global"
categories: blog
---

The interplay between domestic and international politics is fascinating and enlightening.

Notes:

* If global actions seem bizarre, ask yourself, do you understand the domestic context?
* Example: North Korea
* Respect and Value are often confused and conflated
* Theory of Mind

## The Two-Body Problem

Perception of value can be characterized as global, or domestic.

Notes 2:

* Group Perceptions - What does it mean for a group to percieve?
* Canonical form - Observations relative to a perciever
* Self deception and self perception
* Can we remove the 'F' arrow? Only if it provides at least one unique scenario
* Changes references of `Body` to `Group`
