It's not a new idea that simply by spending a large amount of time with someone
you gain influence on their behavior, if not their ideas. I'm sure you've seen
this in your daily lives. You've ended up spending a lot of time with an
acquaintence whose ideas you don't have a high degree of respect for, however,
you find yourself acquiesing to their requests simply through the pressures of
proximity.

Where I think something new may be gleaned on this subject is by taking this
concrete notion into the abstract. When the entity being influenced is more
nebulous than a person and the proximity in question is not simply physical.
So, we have two places to start: Subject and Proximity.
