Constant interuptions kill productivity, but the take away from this should not
be to become a hermit. Hermits may be very productive but they lose touch with
the rest of the world. When they emerge with their results, they find that humanity
has moved on. That their results interest nobody, that other people have already
produced better results, and worst of all, that they have lost the friends that
they used to have who would have listened to them regardless of these other
downfalls.
