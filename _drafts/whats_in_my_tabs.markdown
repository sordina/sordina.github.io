This is the start of a new post series titled "What's in my Tabs?"

In it, I go through each of my open browser tabs and explain why its there. In
the future I won't repeat tabs that have been previously discussed unless their
presence has a new significance. I'm also hoping that this will help me clear
out old tabs that I've never got around to reading, and give me a higher-level
understanding of the tabs that I have open.

Without Further Ado...

At the [most recent Haskell meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Haskell-Users-Group/events/227180247/)
we discussed Freer Monads (Tab 12). During the course of the meetup
[Ken Scambler](https://twitter.com/kenscambler) lent his assistance in
understanding some of the category-theoretic concepts involved and also
provided some links giving deeper explanations. One of those concepts was Kan
Extensions.

This is one of the links that Ken referred us to.

P.S. Ken is an absolute beast! Don't pass up the chance to talk to him about this kind of stuff!
