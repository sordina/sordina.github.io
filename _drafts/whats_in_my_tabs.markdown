Repeating the idea from [last time](/blog/2016/02/17/1455690670-whats_in_my_tabs.html),
I've got a new set of tabs that have been hanging around...

<!--more-->

1. [Google Keep for Work](http://keep.google.com/)
2. [External Sort](https://github.com/sseefried/external-sort/blob/master/src/Data/ExternalSort/Internal.hs)
3. [Metropolis–Hastings Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm)
4. [Noon van der Silk - Introduction to quantum computing and the surface code](http://silky.github.io/posts/2014-09-09-intro-to-qc-and-the-surface-code.html)
5. [Schumann - Kinderszenen, Op. 15 (Maria João Pires)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiMFICjD5Hg)

### Tab 1 - (Sticky) Google Keep for Work

I've been using Google Keep at work too lately. The sharing capability makes it really
great for keeping simple lists, such as an office shopping-list, etc.

### Tab 2 - Sean Seefried - External Sort

My friend Sean's implementation of a sorting algorithm that keeps most of the data
on-disk. Implemented in Haskell using the Pipes library.

### Tab 3 - Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

Wiki page on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. I've been doing some data-science
consulting related work recently, and wanted to brush up on my understanding
of the MH algorithm. Still brushing, apparently.

### Tab 4 - Noon Silk's post on Quantum Computing and the Surface Code

I've read through this a couple of times, but it's just not sticking so far...

### Tab 5 - Schumann played by Maria Pires

I do love Schumann.
