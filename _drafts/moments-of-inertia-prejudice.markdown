Extreme opinions on neuanced topics are a-dime-a-dozen. It's easy to ignore the
fact that there are many diverse views on these kinds of subjects and focus only
on your own, but another common occurance is creating extreme cacacatures of
the other opinions on the topic.

Some examples of this:

* Programming Languages: Haskellers are Arrogant
* Religion: Christians believe that the earth was created 7000 years ago
* Terrorism: Terrorism is scary common

The problem here is that the population concerned with the subject is
large, and by focusing on extremes, you ignore the neuances of the individuals
involved. It's far better to jettison your generalizations and focus on any
particular individual if the opportunity arises. The variations in their
behaviours and views will far exceed the bounds of the generalizations
you have established about their category.

But what if you don't have an individual to focus on, or what if you're
making decisions about groups? Surely there must be better ways to make
generalizations that don't fall into the trap of simple caracature?
The layman's statistical tool here is the average - Simply normalizing to the
group... But shouldn't extreme views carry more weight?
Even if there is a small subgroup of individuals within a group with extreme
views, you should grant more weight to these oppinions as they have a greater
impact on perceptions, as well as the direction of the groups actions.

There is, however, another tool that is conceptually simple, and should be
able to be calculated if you can calculate an average, with just one other
piece of information - what you feel should be considered "neutral".
This tool is the Moment-of-Inertia[^1]
