This is the start of a series of my insights into how to play J.S. Bach's
six Cello Suites, BWV 1007 to 1012.

# Aproach

* I will cheat - If I can't play something, I'll invent a simpler approach.

# Notes

* Your mental model of the music
* Keeping everything in your head
* Enough time to interpret upcomming phrases
