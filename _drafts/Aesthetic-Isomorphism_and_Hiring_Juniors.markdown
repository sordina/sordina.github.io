What is a great violin?

A great violin has a great build, great sound, great
herritage and a great history, but is a great violin what makes a great
violinist so remarkable? Why does Joshua Bell own the Gibson Stradivarius? Is
it because he needs it to play his signature great performances?

<!--more-->

No. Bell owns it because he was skilled and successful enough to be able to pay
$4 million to Norbert Brainin for the instrument. Joshua Bell could play
a mind-blowing performance on a cheap Chinese factory-made violin. It would be
better than what almost anyone could expect to play on the best violin that
exists.

What am I getting at here?

Your company is the violinist and your new-hire is the violin.

You may percieve your company as a virtuoso in its field, but you are not yet
wealthy enough to go out and buy a bunch of Stradivarius graduates as juniors.
You need to be able to work effectively with someone who may not have...

* "Great Build"     - An attitue befitting the kind of work they will perform
* "Great Sound"     - The fully developed skillset you want
* "Great Herritage" - A prestigious education
* "Great History"   - An impressive C.V.

There is something they must have though, or they are a non-starter.

Great Aesthetics.

Here is where my violin metaphor becomes too stretched. Let's get down to
brass tacks.

## Aesthetics Matter

If you have aesthetics in a domain then you have a heuristic that will save
you when you are down-and-out. You have a means to harshly criticize yourself,
and others. You will develop a language to communicate your ideas with passion
and conviction. You can paint in broard strokes your intentions for an undertaking
and fill in the blanks later. You can see a path through adversity. You can
imagine how to change a broken construction into a functional and beautiful one.
There is no limit to what a powerful aesthetic will improve.

If you don't believe this then watch someone with stunted aesthitics in any
of the situations described above. You will become a believer.

If a candidate has a strong aesthetic in our problem domains then I would take
them over someone with any of the "Great" points I listed earlier. However,
that dilemma will likely never eventuate because if someone arrives with Build,
Sound, Herritage and History, then they will most likely have a good aesthetic
too. Still, test this.


## Translated Aesthetics

It's too much to ask that a new-hire, especially a junior will walk in the door
with a fully-developed and finely tuned aesthetic directly related to the
problem domains that they will be working on. Obviously if they have it, then
that's just wonderful, but it is unlikely. It is even more unlikely if you
are breaking new ground in your work and discovering and creating new
problem domains.

Well then, what can you do about it?

Here is where I start speculating because I'm at the beginning of my journey
with this experiment, but I believe that the key is to find an aesthetic seed.
I'm guessing that if someone has a very-strong aesthetic in ANY area; Music, Art,
Sport, Literature or what-ever, then this can be translated far more easily to
another domain than trying to build an aesthetic from scratch.


## A First Aesthetic is Hard-Won

Building a first aesthetic is something like a 10-year task. It is just not
possible to do quickly. The primary reason for this is that the main way
that an aesthetic is developed is through negative-reinforcement. A dissonance
with the core of the existing aesthetic that is already posessed. If there is
no core, then through primitive means - such as reward or punishment.

I won't stray too long on this point, as my conclusion is that it is just too
hard to develop a ground-up aesthitc in a new-hire. It will take too long, be
too painful, and drain too many other people's time. It is a bridge too far.
If you find that your candidate does not have a very strong aesthetic in ANY
other area, then they better be able to do some job you have in mind
immediately, or it is a no-hire situation.


## Analogy

Translating an aesthetic from on domain to another is a large effort.
Archimedes said:

> Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.

If you wish to be able to perform this aesthetic translation, then you need
a lever and a fulcrum. The fulcrum is analogy, and the moving the lever is
examples and extension.
