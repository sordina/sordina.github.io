title: "Naming Things"

Legend goes that there are two hard problems in
computer-science: "Caching", and "Naming Things".

The most difficult task in the quest of naming a thing is finding
a name that is meaningful, representitive, descriptive, and catchy...
All at the same time.
This task is so enticing and compelling
that once the author has accomplished the task, either through
struggle, or great fortune, they forget that the quest is not
yet over.

Our intrepid author should remember not to lose sight
of other easier, more boring, but equally important rules
surrounding the primary task:

* Don't steal other peoples names.
* Don't pick names that for technical reasons are undiscoverable.
* Don't pick names that for technical reasons, will not lead to the names recipient

These are all really the same requirement: Make your name unambiguous.

## How can you do this?

It depends what context you're working in, but say if you were about to...

### Publish a Shiny-New Application, Then

* If then name is unpronounceable
* If you Google the name, and it
	- Already exists as a the name of a software project of any form
	- Is a highly ranked search term with great competition
	- Will escape search due to its punctuation
	
... do not use it. Find another name.

## Some Bad Offenders:

### Go

<https://www.thoughtworks.com/go/>

It is ungoogleable without more context, already exists as an unrelated popular
software-project, and is a highly competetive search term. But worst of all it
fails at all components of the primary task of naming things. It is meaningless,
unrepresentitive, undescriptive, and just plain bland. Why why why??

I once asked a ThoughtWorks employee if this had been an issue for them, and
they said it had not. I suppose it couldn't have hurt in-person enterprise sales,
but it certainly could have been named better.

### Shakespeare

<https://github.com/paulca/shakespeare>

<https://github.com/yesodweb/shakespeare>

These are both popular open-source libraries. I don't even care who came first.
Whoever was second should have chosen another name. Not to mention that
"Shakespeare" is already a very competetive search term. At least it is
relevant to the domain of content authoring and text.


### Visual Studio Code

"Let's Encrypt - For Go!"

A two-for-one here. Very cute, but seriously?
