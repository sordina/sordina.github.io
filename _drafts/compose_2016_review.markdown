Exciting News!

The Compose :: Melbourne 2016 committee has reconvened to make a decision on weather to
run the event again in 2017. Everything is looking quite favorable for a continuation
of last-year's inaugural Melbourne-based functional-programming conference.
However, something that we had promised we would do (and as part of the preamble to running the event
this year) was a review of last-year's event. The review had been continually delayed for the
obvious reason - we were all exhausted from running Compose :: Melbourne in 2016 and
there was no pressing need to do it. Well, now that the motions of a new event have begun it
seems like a good time to put a little retrospective into order.

I thought that rather than try to do this as a collaborative piece of work, instead I could
write up my thoughts in a blog-post, and if the other members of the committee wanted to
remark on their experiences too then they could do the same, or at least suggest amendments
to this post.
