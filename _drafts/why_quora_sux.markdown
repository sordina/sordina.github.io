[Quora](https://www.quora.com/) - "The Best Answer to Any Question" serves as a Q&A site
that intends to capture the Expert Answer market outside of the domain of
[Stack-Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/). Meaning, questions that are more subjective,
or about experience, and that do not have a difinitive answer.

This sounds great, so why do I think Quora Sucks?

## Technical Reasons

The technical reasons are already widely acknowledged, so I won't go into them here, but
briefly, they fall into the following categories:

* Quora is spammy
* Quora is a walled garden
* Quora abuses SEO

## Community Reasons

* The top questions are almost all ridiculously stupid
* The top answers almost always serve to show how smart and
  good at outside-the-box thinking the respondent is
