[Quora](https://www.quora.com/) - "The Best Answer to Any Question" serves as a Q&A site
that intends to capture the Expert Answer market outside of the domain of
[Stack-Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/). Meaning, questions that are more subjective,
or about experience, and that do not have a difinitive answer.

This sounds great, so what's wrong with Quora?

## Technical Reasons

The technical reasons are already widely acknowledged, so I won't go into them here, but
briefly, they fall into the following categories:

* Quora is spammy
* Quora is a walled garden
* Quora abuses SEO
* Quora has bad scrollback / link-follow / refresh behaviour
* Quora has bad load-more behaviour

## Community Reasons

* The top questions are almost all ridiculously stupid
* The top answers almost always serve to show how smart and
  good at outside-the-box thinking the respondent is, often
  explicitly ignoring the drive of the question

## Dumb Questions:

* [Is the United States a police state?](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-United-States-a-police-state)

Who could they possibly be hoping answers this?

* [Do you like reading fictions?](https://www.quora.com/Do-you-like-reading-fictions)

What?

* [What is it like to kill someone 2?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-kill-someone-2)

How many times can peope ask this???

* [How do I find an industrial laundry plant?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-an-industrial-laundry-plant)

Is this really something you need to ask on Quora? Who else would be interested in this??

* [Do rich people ever fly coach?](https://www.quora.com/Do-rich-people-ever-fly-coach)

DO THEY???

* [Which special forces has the absolute toughest training in the world?](https://www.quora.com/Which-special-forces-has-the-absolute-toughest-training-in-the-world)

I swear I read this every week.

* So much military stuff
* Ask rich people dumb stuff
* Relationship advice for idiots
* Easily googleable stuff but Quorans are so special, so let's ask them!

## Dumb Answers:

* Let me tell you why your question is dumb, and then not answer it (very popular response)
* I'm so cool
* Detailed tangental boring answer
