Derek Lowe has a series of articles titled "Things I Won’t Work With" [^1],
where he talk about dangerous chemicals, and why he's afraid of them.
A trait of the software industry is a form of macho-bravado, where
although people might shy away from particular technologies, they
will recount with glee the fact that they had the fortune to
experience working with them. This may rub off on some impressionable
new developers that they should jump in and get their hands dirty
with these infamous things. By publishing a series of posts in the
style of Derek's "Won't Work With" articles, I hope to provide
some balance to this prospect.
