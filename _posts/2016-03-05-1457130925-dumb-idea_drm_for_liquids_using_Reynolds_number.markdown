So I've got a soap dispenser...

<!--more-->

It's pretty cool.

It has some kind of sensor, so that it knows when your hands are
underneath the nozzle, and then dispenses a serving of liquid-soap.
It saves you from having to pump a little thing, and I guess
actually saves me a tiny bit of time each day, and lets me get
the soap one-handed. Nice.

The funny thing is that these kind of gadgets are super cheap.
They're usually cheaper, I suspect, than the cost of manufacture.
The way that the companies that make such gadget recoup their
costs is the same as the budget-printer industry - refills.

The refills cost a lot, and are pretty tiny. In order to stop
you simply getting soap from a different source, the company will
make your life difficult in various trivial ways so that
it is more inconvenient to work around the issue than to buy
more ElectroSoapCo (TM) brand refills, even though the prices
are extortionate.

Some of the impediments:

* Valve-like nozzles to prevent refills
* Odd bottle-shapes to prevent competing refills
* Smart nozzles to protect against tampering
* Many more weird and wonderful frustrations

Well, I was having none of it. So my partner melted a hole in the top
of the canister and then bought some generic brand hand-soap to refill
the dispenser. Worked like a charm. Take that "the-man".

But what if I was the man...?

Here's my dumb idea -

Create an internal mechanism for the pump that depends on specific
physical properties of their soap - I.e. Viscosity and Reynolds
number. It should even be possible to find these properties that
work for the existing mechanism and decrease the window of
acceptance for a liquid. This way you can refill the machine
however you like, but you've gotta buy the right soap, otherwise
the machine will just jam, or leak, or if they want to be nice,
warn you and not operate.

This DRM solution is low-tech, cheap, and reliable. It moves the
problem from the auxiliary space - canisters, to the fundamental
space - the liquid they wish to sell and you wish to use.
It would be easy for a competitor to copy your soap's properties,
but the soap market is a very different space to the canister
market. I think the bang-for-buck would be very good.

Interesting that I haven't seen this before :)
