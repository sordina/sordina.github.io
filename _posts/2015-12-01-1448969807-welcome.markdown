This is a place for ideas, reactions, etc.

I'm still putting the look-and-feel of the blog together, so
expect the structure and style of the site to change frequently
for the next while.
I'm also brain-dumping a lot of ideas since I haven't used a blog
in a while, so if the editing quality is rough, expect the posts
to be retroactively improved in the future.

I've named the blog "Bows and Arrows - Composition as Expression"
as I've found that a compositional approach to problem solution
is a very re-usable tool, as well as being easy to explain.
