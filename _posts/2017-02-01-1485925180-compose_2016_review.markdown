Exciting News!

The Compose :: Melbourne 2016 committee has reconvened to make a decision on weather to
run the event again in 2017. Everything is looking quite favorable for a continuation
of last-year's inaugural Melbourne-based functional-programming conference.
However, something that we had promised we would do (and as part of the preamble to running the event
this year) was a review of last-year's event. The review had been continually delayed for the
obvious reason - we were all exhausted from running Compose :: Melbourne in 2016 and
there was no pressing need to do it. Well, now that the motions of a new event have begun it
seems like a good time to put a little retrospective into order.

I thought that rather than try to do this as a collaborative piece of work, instead I could
write up my thoughts in a blog-post, and if the other members of the committee want to
remark on their experiences too then they can do the same, or at least suggest amendments
to this post.

## Just the Feelings

Last year, when the committee set the plan in motion to run the conference, we had a
high-degree of uncertainty about the level of demand for such an event in Melbourne.
We decided to put everything together on a shoe-string budget and go in with
low-expectations. We figured that even if there was no sponsorship and a low
turnout, it would at-least be a fun extension of the Meetup
groups that we run.

Thankfully, our expectations were well and truly exceeded by the
turnout and events at Compose :: Melbourne 2016.
Positive experiences were retold to us by many of the attendees and speakers, with
a desire to see the event run again next-year.
Some of the constructive criticism that we received included remarks that it might
make sense to partition the first-day into two tracks - one for beginners and one
for advanced practitioners. There was also a desire to see more
structure for the unconference on day-two.

## Just the Numbers

While I could go on for some time about how the conference was organised and
how the days played-out it might be interesting to take a look at some of the
raw facts about Compose :: Melbourne 2016.

### Artefacts

While the conference was a fun and illuminating event for those who attended,
we strived to extend the reach of the proceedings by taking time to ensure that
they were captured and spread to an audience far wider than those who came
on the day. The videography performed by Takeshi and its promotion were the
primary way that this was achieved. It's always nice to come across someone
with a Compose :: Melbourne bag, sticker, or t-shirt since it shows that the
conference really happened.

to make happen, but thankfully we should be able to reuse a large portion of that
work when it runs again.
