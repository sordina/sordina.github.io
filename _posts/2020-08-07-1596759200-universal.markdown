<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"> This post is a work in progress. </span>

There are attributes that you may posess that could be considered virtues
that transcend the familiar ethical virtues, in that they will make you more
successful in any venture regardless of its ethical motivations or outcomes.

Strength is the most obvious. A strong person has the power to perform a good
or evil act with more magnitude than a weak person. And if they set upon a venture,
their likelyhood to succeed will be predicated on a certain threshold of strength.

There are other less obvious virtues.

In contrast to virtues, vices appear to be trivially opposed. For example, strength has
the corresponding vice of weakness. There may be virtues and vices that fall
outside of this obvious correspondence, but we will need to analyse the
definitions in order to see if that is worth exploring. For now, let's put that
idea aside and step through examples for scrutiny. It may arise that a counter-
example is found by proceeding in this manner.

I will enumerate some candidate themes and discuss weather they agree
with this idea of an abstract universal virtue.


### Privelage

I first started thinking about this concept from the perspective of privelage -
Institutional privelage has been a very hot topic of discussion recently but
considering institution equal for the present, individual privelage is also
an interesting idea to explore. The most commonly analysed form of individual
privelage discussed is wealth, and rightly so as this is not only influential
but also stratifying and fluidly transferrable.

What interests me is the granting of moral weight to certain types of privelage
that are inherently orthogonal to morals. The first that I considered is memory.
Good memory seems to be implicitly granted high moral-standing while poor memory
relegated to a vice, even though this is a highly intrinsic and inflexible
attribute to posess.

These thoughts are in no way intended to detract from the discussion of privelage
from the perspective of institutions, class, and wealth. It is intended more
as a new avenue of analysis rather than diminishing existing discourse.


### Candidates

Some of these will be obvious and frequently referenced, however the less
obvious of these may be interesting to consider. Often they may be grouped
under terms more frequently referenced in this context, but considering them
in isolation may be interesting.

What is included vs. excluded? These should be intrinsic traits. They may
be developed but should be independent of external posessions - for example,
wealth would fall under this list, but I wouldn't consider it an abstract
virtue as it may be granted or taken away at any time. (is this a useful scalpal?)
