If you want to practice mindfulness, then give page-turning a go. Ask your
musician friends if they would like you to page-turn for them during a practice
session. It's not hard to get the hang of, but it demands very high
concentration none-the-less.

I'm not sure if I subscribe to the benefits of perpetual mindfulness, but I do
think that intermittent practice can have real impact. This is a fun and easy
way to trigger the experience. I think even more-so if you're not a musician.
