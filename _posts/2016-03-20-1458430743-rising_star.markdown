The concept of modern stardom hits like a rock to the back of the head.
Shock, haze and a red-fade to concussion.

What is a star?

A star is silent. Old. Fading. It rises in perpetuity, but can only be seen in
the quiet dark. It is easily drowned out.

A star has one strength. Its purity. The sound of a star would be a single high harmonic
note on a violin that emerges as the orchestral ruckus dims.
