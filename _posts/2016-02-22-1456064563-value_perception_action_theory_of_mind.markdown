I started writing this post in an attempt to capture certain ideas about how
value is projected, and how those projections can be misconstrued. Halfway there
I began to realize that I was instead creating a kind of embedded language for
discussing the perceptions of actions in general. This post will, therefore,
focus on the idea of action perception, with some examples. I will soon write
another post to get back to the original topic viewed from with the help of the
ideas discussed here.

Let's talk a little about the title.

Most of the interactions in our day-to-day lives are
just that - actions. These actions occur between people,
groups, objects, or are self-inflicted. We mostly limit
our conversations about these actions to remarks about
their circumstances, and the details involved in their
construction and execution. However,
[if a tree falls in a forest, and it is not perceived, does it still make a sound?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest)
It is important to keep in mind the contexts and interpretations
of the _perceptions_ of actions that occur.

## Action

An action is an objective real-world event that occurs between
concrete or abstract entities within in the world.

> Bob pours himself a glass of water.

## Observation

An observation is the concrete phenomenon of the receipt of information
by an entity pertaining to an action.

> Alice hears Bob pour the water from another room.

## Perception

Perception is the witnessing-entity's understanding of the
information pertaining to the action that it observed.

> Alice understands that that someone in the other room poured a liquid into a vessel.

## Inaction

The simplest form of action is no action at all.
It exhibits no observable phenomenon aside from a lack
of observations. Still, although there are no observations
to be made, there are still an infinity of perceptions
of inaction that are possible through the interpretation
of the meaning of the non-event.

There could be a wealth of content to be written about
inaction, but I won't touch on it any further here. Instead focusing
on singular observable actions.

## Parties

Although actions cab be described as occurring between abstract entities,
the simplest type of entity is the "Party". A party is a single actor
such as a person, or animal. Parties can perform and receive actions,
but they can also observe and perceive actions. Parties can also go
further and extend thought processes further than simple interpretations of
the concrete.

A simple diagram of three parties can be shown as follows:

	Alice     Bob
	
	          Carol

## Self-Action

The simplest concrete action is self-action. This is because it requires
only one entity to perform and receive the action. The same entity
can observe and perceive the action, and their thoughts need pertain
only to themselves.

An example of a self-action could be Bob's refreshment from earlier:

> Bob pours himself a glass of water.


## One-Party Problem

The previous example of Bob's refreshment (sans witnesses) is a variant
of what I call "The One-Party Problem". A Party performs an Action upon
itself. It observes that action, and perceives it. Although this seems
to be a contrived and solipsistic construction of an example, there is still
something to be gained by examining the forces at play in the scenario.

* Are actions in this scenario important?
* Can the party involved form an objective interpretation of the events that unfolded?
* How linked are action, observation, and perception?
* Is the party merely perceiving the scenario, or also transformed by those perceptions?

And so, the "Perceptive-Graph" for the One-Party Problem:

	   /-----+
	   :     : AP1
	   :     v
	Party 1 ---+
	   ^       |
	   |   A   |
	   |       |
	   \-------+

* One party acts on itself
* "Party 1" represents the party
* "A" represents the action
* There is an implicit group present containing "Party 1", however, this doesn't matter for single parties
* "AP1" represents "Party 1"s perception of action "A"

Currently AP1 is explicitly drawn on the graph, however, there are such
arrows from every party to every action, so we may leave them out of the
diagrams and refer to them via the convention (Action)-(Party).
These can then be referenced and discussed in tabular form.

The diagram then simply becomes an Action-Entity graph. In this example:

	Party 1 ---+
	   ^       |
	   |   A   |
	   |       |
	   \-------+

## Analysis

For any particular Action-Entity graph an analysis can be performed.
This takes the form of a series of levels of descriptions. With the items being
described becoming more abstract with each level.

The levels begin as follows:

* Parties, Groups and Actions
* Observations and Perceptions
* Theory Of Mind

After the initial action-entity diagram has been constructed, each successive
level of abstraction can be generated by taking the cross-product of the
previous level of abstraction with the set of entities. For example, each party
perceives all actions, and each party also models all such perceptions.
For scenarios composed of many entities and actions, this can lead to
a combinatorial explosion of descriptions. However, if you refer to entities
purely through abstract circumstance, then you will find that many of these
descriptions will be identical, and their implications only need to be
considered once.

There is no limit to how many levels of abstraction can be analysed, but
three should be sufficient for most practical discussion.

Here is analysis of the One-Party Problem

## Analysis of the Abstract One Party Problem

	Party 1 ---+
	   ^       |
	   |   A   |
	   |       |
	   \-------+

### Analysis of

| Parties | Party 1 |
| Actions | A       |

### Parties' Interpretation of Actions

| ----- | ------- | ----------| --------------------------- |
| ID    | Action  | Observer  | How does a [X] perceive...  |
| ----- | ------- | ----------| --------------------------- |
| AP1   | A       | Party 1   | [Party] its actions towards itself?

## Mis-Perception

Where there is perception, as distinct from observation, there
is always mis-perception. An understanding of events that does
not reflect reality. In the analysis of abstract entity-action
scenarios this is not terribly interesting, however, in concrete
scenarios it is very important. The mis-understanding of various
parties should be derived so that their future behaviour can be
better predicted, and so that the models of their understanding
by other parties can be improved.

## Two-Party Problem

Here, I present the two-party problem. Two concrete entities with
a single action from one to the other. No self-actions are presented
as, while these are very interesting, they don't add anything
new to the scenario.

	          A
	Party 1 ----> Party 2


### Analysis of

| Parties | Party 1, Party 2 |
| Actions | A                |

### Partiesâ€™ Interpretation of Actions

| ----- | ------- | ----------| ----------------------------- |
| ID    | Action  | Observer  | How does a Party perceive...  |
| ----- | ------- | ----------| ----------------------------- |
| AP1   | A       | Party 1   | Its actions towards another party?
| AP2   | A       | Party 2   | the actions of another party towards itself?

This scenario provides one of the simplest, yet non-trivial diagrams in terms
of the actions and entities involved. While it is extraordinarily simple,
I believe that most situational analysis attempts to reduce any complexity
down to this model. This is deficient in many situations and can only provide
a cursory and limited understanding of the perceptions, specifically mis-perceptions
as well as how they relate to an objective truth, in terms of individuals,
and especially groups.


## Theory of Mind

Once multiple parties are involved, it becomes useful to begin exploring the concept
of ["Theory of Mind (ToM)."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind)
Theory of Mind as a concept has been used extensively in psychological and
animal-behaviour research in order to understand the nuances and sophistication
of a subject's mental models of other actors.
Tests for the presence of ToM in subjects include observing food-hiding
behaviours in the company of other animals, etc.
Theory of Mind comprises the third level of action-entity analysis, forming
the cross-product of perceptions and entities.

For example, the One-Party Problem yields not just self-perception, but also
an inner theory of the party's own mind:

| ----- | --------| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ID    | Action  | Observer   | Theorist | What are a Party's thoughts about... |
| ----- | --------| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AP1P1 | A       | Party 1    | Party 1  | the perception of its actions towards itself?


This is all very self-obsessed, so let's view ToM in the context of the Two-Party
Problem (with the diagram again for reference):

	          A
	Party 1 ----> Party 2

| ----- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ID    | Action   | Observer   | Theorist   | What are a Party's thoughts about...  |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| AP1P1 | A        | Party 1    | Party 1    | its perceptions of its own actions towards another party?
| AP1P2 | A        | Party 1    | Party 2    | another party's perceptions of that party's actions towards itself?
| AP2P1 | A        | Party 2    | Party 1    | another party's perceptions of its actions towards that party?
| AP2P2 | A        | Party 2    | Party 2    | its perceptions of another party's actions towards it?

I'm sure that as you read the descriptions in the table above you feel frustrated
at just how limited the English language is at describing multi-layered entity
interactions in an abstract fashion. However, it is not good enough to simply
use names and make each entity explicit in the descriptions, as the
relativistic form that the descriptions take is what allows them to be compared
for equality.

That being said, let's put Theory of Mind aside for now, it being enough that the
concept is codified as a level, so that it can be referred to later.

## Bodies

So far, we have looked at simple scenarios involving multiple parties, and multiple
levels of interpretation of the actions involved between those parties. From here,
it's easy to imagine scenarios that you're already familiar with, and how this
framework may make it easier to describe what is occurring, however, even with
a plethora more parties and actions involved, there is still a crucial concept
that must be added before any greater numeric complexity is accrued.
This concept is the notion of groups, or bodies. It is what allows us to say
"we", "the opposition", "our allies", etc.

There is a huge degree of nuance involved with the concept of groups, but for
simplicities sake, we'll simply say that a party is either in a group, or isn't.
Our examples will use groups that do not overlap, and that don't contain
sub-groups. A group is _not_ a party, but it _is_ an entity.

	\-------> Party 2    | <--/
	      |              |
	      +--------------+

### Analysis of

| Parties | Party 1, Party 2 |
| Groups  | Body 1           |
| Actions | A, B, C, D       |

### Interpretation of Actions

| ----- | -------- | ----------| -------------------------- |
| ID    | Action   | Observer  | How does a [X] perceive... |
| ----- | -------- | ----------| -------------------------- |
| AB1   | A        | Body 1    | [Group] the interaction between two of its members?
| BB1   | B        | Body 1    | [Group] the actions of one of its members to itself?
| CB1   | C        | Body 1    | [Group] the actions of itself to one of its members?
| DB1   | D        | Body 1    | [Group] its own actions towards itself?
| AP1   | A        | Party 1   | [Party] its own actions towards a fellow party?
| BP1   | B        | Party 1   | [Party] its own actions towards its group?
| CP1   | C        | Party 1   | [Party] its group's actions towards a fellow party?
| DP1   | D        | Party 1   | [Party] its group's actions towards itself?
| AP2   | A        | Party 2   | [Party] a fellow party's actions towards it?
| BP2   | B        | Party 2   | [Party] a fellow party's actions towards its group?
| CP2   | C        | Party 2   | [Party] its group's actions towards it?
| DP2   | D        | Party 2   | (Same as DP1)

The first impression we get from this table is that there are quite a few more
rows than last time. The first example had one descriptive row, the second - four.
And now, this slightly more involved example has 12.

The number of rows follows a formula: `N = A * E ^ (L - 1)`.

In this case, `12 = 4 * 3 ^ (2 - 1)`.

	N = 12         = Number of Descriptions
	A =  4         = Actions
	E =  3 = B + P = Entities
	B =  1         = Bodies
	P =  2         = Parties
	L =  2 = Level = "Description of Perception"

We also see the first occurrence of a descriptive equality. The perceptions
`DP1 = DP2` up to description. No matter which party is observing it, the group
acting upon itself is described the same way. So in actual fact, the formula
should really take this into account. The number we've derived `N` is the
upper bound in the number of descriptions, however, once duplicates are
removed, the real number may be lower. Finding a formula for that number
is left as an exercise to the reader.

There are some other phenomenon that appear for the first time in this scenario.

## Group-Action

Here is where the first non-concrete diagrammatic representation creeps in.
Clearly, there is no single instance of "group-action" in the real world,
however, we have drawn an arrow representing an action, from the group
to various entities, including the group itself. Weather or not this is
permissible is left up to the drafter of the diagram that represents any
particular scenario. I include the representation in order to capture
the idea of multi-action aggregates, or notional perception of implied
aggregate-action.

What does this actually mean? It means that a person can perceive an
action as originating from a group, and a group can perceive actions
as being directed at it. I'm sure that many exciting examples
spring immediately to mind after hearing this proposition.

Group-Action, specifically, could be a perception that is unwarranted
in a particular scenario, i.e. there was no aggregate of party-actions
that would warrant such a perception. There may have never even been
a party-action whatsoever. But as I wrote earlier, all perceptions are
mis-perceptions anyway, so... Who cares? Let's draw an arrow regardless.

## Group-Perceptions

In addition to the perceptions of actions as having originated from groups,
is there such a phenomenon as a collective perception? Our arrows indicate
that we are modelling it, and while its manifestation may be non-physical,
it is often written about. And in terms of a theory of mind, the mind itself
need not exist for the theory to be concrete.

Since we're not currently in the business of establishing objective truth, the
arrows of group perception can stay too.

## The Two-Body, Two-Parties-Per-Body Problem

Finally, we come to the abstract form of the scenario that I originally wanted
to describe. Two bodies, each with two parties. Each party and each body
acting towards various other entities and themselves. I've tried to limit
the number of actions so that most symmetries are broken. We want to
construct a diagram such that the number of possible duplicate descriptions
is kept to a minimum. This was achieved mostly through intuition.
I'd love to find out if there is a more rigorous way to attack such
a goal.

This diagram is intended to be sufficient to represent various simple forms
of both inter and intra-organizational collaboration, conflict,
communication, perception, and action. The entities involved
are intended to be kept to a minimum, and there should be an economy of
action between those entities. This should not only allow the description
of objective facts, but also present a model for the description of
misunderstanding, mis-perception, miscommunication, and confusion
in general, both accidental, and intentionally constructed.
Note that this framework doesn't put forward any solutions
or resolutions, merely provides a descriptive language to be
used in the discussions required to formulate ones own course
of action:

	           Body 1                  Body 2
	      +--------------+        +--------------+
	      |              |   A    |              |

	           +---/                   +---/

(Note: I may be able to remove actions I,J, and L after some consideration)

This totals 84 descriptions - Including duplicates.

Using the formula shown earlier: `N = A * E ^ (L - 1) = 12 * (5+2) ^ (2-1) = 84`.

This same scenario would lead to `7056` theories of mind. That's a hell of a lot
of complexity, and this is one of the simplest inter-group scenarios possible.

That being said, the ToM angle is definitely one of the most useful in terms
of resolving misunderstandings, as it is also one of the beliefs that is
often most loosely held. So, how can one go about analysing such a plethora
of theories-of-mind? Should one even bother to try at all?
If you were to examine just a subset, how would you choose the candidates?

I suppose that the easiest approach may just be to take any particular
situation at face-value until you smell something fishy, then
follow your nose until you can see a path ahead that leads you
to some potentially broken theories. These can then form the
foundation of your investigation. Branching via connected
action from party-to-party, uncovering mis-perception and
observational obscurity as you go...

## What's Missing?

There's been a lot covered in this post, so the following
have had to be left out for now...

* Self action in multi-party and group scenarios
* Beyond Theory of Mind
* Concrete examples of action-entity diagrams
* Theory of mind in group dynamics
* An unambiguous language for relativistic perceptive description
* A method for generating description tables
* Automatic duplicate removal
* A formula for description-numbers sans-duplicates
* Methods of aggregation for perceived actions
* Methods of aggregation for perception of actions
* The bad-pineapple (tropical-geometry)

## What's Next?

This post has been laying the groundwork for future discussions.
I'd like to take this framework and use it to analyse various
contentious situations to see if there can be a better understanding
of conflict, and what paths might be navigated to resolve it.

There are a lot of words written here, but hopefully I've kept it
simple. The main take-away should be the notion of the
action-entity diagram and the tabular descriptive analysis format.

Stay tuned!
