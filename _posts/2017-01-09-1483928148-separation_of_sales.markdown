Something counter-intuitive occurs when you take someone versed in sales
and in development and ask them to do both on a project. There are two forces
at play that are very productive if they can be resolved - narrative forces, and
the scientific forces. Sales tells a lead a story where the lead is the main character.
This doesn't focus on the obstacles to engineering the details that the story
entails by design. Sales is about driving desire. Of course, the pitch must be achievable
at least in part otherwise reputation will suffer, but the constraints of the story need
not be made explicit to the lead. Development on the other hand focuses almost entirely
on uncovering the constraints of the solutions described. The tension between vision
and realisation can be a very productive driving force for a business, but only when
managed carefully. The division of roles aids in this management in ways that are very
difficult to manifest in a single person.

This tensile force hampers both sales development and if a boundary is not established.
How does this happen? In the sales capacity, when in the process of chasing and
closing leads, a sales pitch is hampered by the inherent conservatism of the integral
development mindset of constraint discovery and resolution. A developer must be thinking
at all times - "Why won't this work?" - and when constraints have not been discovered
the usual attitude is to fall back on a reluctance to provide estimates until these
constraints are unearthed. In a development capacity, when building the solution,
the promises made during the sales process will create a cognitive-dissonance which
prevent the scrutiny of the constraints surrounding the solution that would lead to
the quickest illumination of dead-ends.

A split-personality is required
In order to maintain both of these mindsets without dampening the productivity required
for the roles. This split simply shuts off the sales or
development mindset as the situation demands - much easier said than done.
An external perspective on where the forces are out of alignment can provide a more
objective view on the "delta" forces required to restore the balance to within productive
limits. Of course, these forces are not at play, at least not to a significant degree, when
selling an already established product. This is because an understanding of what the
product can deliver is already largely fleshed-out, and there really isn't any development
work left to complete besides any integrations required.

What's the take-away from all this ruminating? For management I suppose that it
helps clarify the value of the separation of roles. For an individual who is acting
in both a sales and development capacity it should show that the careful cultivation
of operational modes and mindsets can be extremely useful - although a bath of fire
should cement this intuitively, it still pays to reflect on what exactly causes this
as the natural response to conflicting dynamics.
